implement extra filtering based on this requirements:
firstly, change logic to only show books where coursereserves_reserves__t__.__current = True (boolean)
- next, allow the user to filter by 'Show historical data' using the json. This will have to be a text field, input 1 or 0 in the text field to indicate yes or no, due to technical limitations.
-- if 1, then do not filter by __current. add a return field to show whether it is current or not. 

next, 

- User can input a 'Term', instead of filtering by a date range. The list of possible terms is as follows: 
Law 2025 Spring
2024 Fall Quarter
2025 Winter Quarter
2025 Spring Quarter
2024 Summer Session
Permanent
Law 2024 Summer
Law 2024 Fall
2025 Summer Term
2025 Fall Quarter
2026 Winter Quarter
2026 Spring Quarter
Law 2025 Summer
Law 2025 Fall
Law 2026 Spring

define coursereserves_terms__t__ as terms
This input exists on terms.name
based on input if a matching term is found, this will filter by checkout dates terms.start_date and terms.end_date, instead of $1 and $2.

next, we have to filter by currently running courses, as the current logic pulls from historical courses. 
Allow to user to filter by "show historical course under same name", using the same 1/0 text box. If it is 0 or empty, follow this logic.
--- match coursereserves_courses__t__.course_listing_id to coursereserves_courselistings__t__.id 
--- take those and filter for terms.term_id, and find the term's start/end date using terms.start_date and terms.end_date. if the CURRENT TIME is between those two dates, then the course is ACTIVE. We only want to see results from active courses.
